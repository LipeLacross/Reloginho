# Reloginho

Reloginho is an interactive game where the player bets on which "hour" the pointer of a customizable clock will stop. The number of hours on the clock is adjustable, and the more hours the player chooses, the higher the difficulty but also the greater the potential reward.

## üî® Project Features

- **Choose the number of hours**: The player can choose between 6, 12, 24, and 60 hours to set up the clock, with different win multipliers for each choice.
- **Bet on a specific hour**: The player selects a specific hour where they believe the pointer will stop.
- **Pointer spin**: The clock‚Äôs pointer spins and stops at a random hour, creating suspense and an interactive experience.
- **Outcome and rewards**: If the pointer stops at the chosen hour, the player wins an amount based on the configured clock multiplier.
